-- | @MonadConc@ is an abstraction over GHC's typical concurrency
-- abstraction. It captures the interface of concurrency monads in
-- terms of how they can operate on shared state and in the presence
-- of exceptions.
--
-- There are a few notable differences between this and the @Par@
-- monad approach: firstly, @Par@ imposes 'NFData' constraints on
-- everything, as it achieves its speed-up by forcing evaluation in
-- separate threads. @MonadConc@ doesn't do that, and so you need to
-- be careful about where evaluation occurs, just like with
-- 'MVar's. Secondly, this builds on @Par@'s futures by allowing
-- @CVar@s which threads can read from and write to, possibly multiple
-- times, whereas with the @Par@ monads it is illegal to write
-- multiple times to the same @IVar@ (or to non-blockingly read from
-- it) which, when there are no exceptions, removes the possibility of
-- data races.
--
-- Every @MonadConc@ has an associated 'MonadSTM', transactions of
-- which can be run atomically.

  -- | Executes a computation with asynchronous exceptions
  -- /masked/. That is, any thread which attempts to raise an

  -- until asynchronous exceptions are unmasked again.
  --
  -- The argument passed to mask is a function that takes as its

  -- | Like 'mask', but the masked computation is not

  -- thread executing in 'uninterruptibleMask' blocks for any reason,
  -- then the thread (and possibly the program, if this is the main
  -- thread) will be unresponsive and unkillable. This function should
  -- only be necessary if you need to mask exceptions around an
  -- interruptible operation, and you can guarantee that the
